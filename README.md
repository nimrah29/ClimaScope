#ClimaScope 

ClimaScope is a simple, elegant, and responsive weather application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It fetches real-time weather data using WeatherAPI and dynamically displays the current temperature, location, time, and weather condition.

Features:

- Search any city to get real-time weather updates
 
- Shows current temperature and weather condition
 
- Displays local time and day of the selected city
 
- Handles invalid city input with user-friendly error messages
 
- Fully responsive for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

Tech Stack:

- HTML5- for structure

- CSS3- with media queries for styling and responsiveness

- JavaScript- for API integration and dynamic content update

- WeatherAPI- for fetching weather data

How It Works:

- On page load, it fetches weather data for a default location (e.g., Lucknow).

- Users can type a city name and click the search button to get updated data.

- Weather information including temperature, condition, date, and local time is updated dynamically 

- using JavaScript DOM manipulation.

- Day of the week is calculated using JavaScriptâ€™s `Date` object.

- If an invalid city is entered, a clean error message is shown instead of breaking the app.
